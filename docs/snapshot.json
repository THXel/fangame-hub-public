      "comment": "Wannafest 22 is currently my #2 favorite fangame. It’s insanely creative, with such a great variety of games — it really feels like a retro game marathon across the whole I Wanna Be The Guy universe.\nThere are so many cool childhood elements in here, and I love how it actually includes the signature mechanics of each main protagonist. The fact that they even carry over the HUD from the respective games is just genius.\n[spoiler]And the 3D sections? Honestly super surprising — I didn’t expect them to work this well, but the execution is really impressive.[/spoiler] Awesome game. I always have a great time coming back to it.",

I had to look something up at one point because, as a beginner I don't have the knowledge to figure it out on my own.\nHere and there, I had a bit of trouble understanding some of the memes, but that’s also part of what makes the WTF moments fun.\nThank you for finally letting me visit the Chicken Nugget Universe and that flamingo earworm. It makes my life a bit happier\nThe final boss was super cool and really creative. This game isn’t too difficult and you can play through it on a relaxing Sunday.\nBossfight\n[spoiler]I found the Miku fight a bit monotonous in terms of the attacks. For example even just having different colored fruits would be an upgrade.[/spoiler]\nLevel\n[spoiler]The part with the Super Mario game and the various mini-bosses was a bit annoying in terms of the path. The bosses were cool especially the Goomba but the overworld was a bit frustrating with the endless invisible blocks. Also the stop-motion with the Boo ghost was really hard to follow since the photo was always in a different position. Maybe that was part of the joke, but for me, it was eye strain[/spoiler]",

      "comment": "I Wanna Be the Boshy was my very first I Wanna Be The Guy fangame. I originally got inspired by watching the runner Witwix speedrun it at GDQ. Back then I didn’t even know I Wanna Be the Guy existed, and I was absolutely blown away: how can a game be that insanely hard, and how can someone clear it that fast?\nSo many moments had me going “WTF is happening?!” and that’s exactly what made me want to try it myself. But when I actually started playing… I didn’t even get past the first boss (Kirby). After what felt like 30 hours, I quit.\nFast forward five years: I started streaming on Twitch, gave it another shot, and finally beat it for the first time. And then I even ended up speedrunning it — which younger me would’ve thought was impossible.",

      "comment": "I Wanna Escape Into My Mind is a really special fangame to me. The fact that it runs in 16:9 thanks to the Unity engine already makes it feel completely different, and it looks great right away.\nI love the level design and all the characters, who are also insanely well animated. The overall difficulty feels solid, and for me the stages are often harder than the bosses. Still, the boss fights were a ton of fun. And the story is genuinely deep.\n[spoiler]One thing that (like many others) sometimes bothers me is the music. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of real bangers in this game. But at times it feels like it’s just screaming into your ears. I can imagine that’s even intentional, since it fits the theme of trying to escape your own mind and the music is supposed to put you under pressure. But “just screaming” isn’t the same as a tense, nerve-grinding atmosphere. Maybe it works at first, but after a while it becomes more annoying than unsettling.[/spoiler]",
